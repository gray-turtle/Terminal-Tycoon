# Terminal-Tycoon

Terminal Tycoon is a small, terminal based game made with python.

You can mine bits, synthesise them into bytes and sell them at the market. You can also hire workers to automate the tasks for you! Try and see how big your business can get!

ToDo:
- upgrade system for workers (faster, more efficient, etc.)
- upgrade system for player
- fix bug that allows negative values if tasks are completed the same time as workers
- Terminal GUI(?)
- live updates so you don't have to send a command to see latest stats
- easy/hard modes
